!lines that start with ! are comments and are treated as if they didn't exist at all
!One blank (so comments don't count) line starts a new section. Pages are assigned automatically by the credits code.
!If there is an equals sign at any point in a line except the beginning, whatever is after it becomes a name variable equal to what comes before it.
!If a line starts with an equals sign, it is replaced with the contents of the name variable. It is an error to use a name variable that hasn't been defined.
!Overwriting name variables is not guaranteed to work. (It probably will, though. Just don't do it.)
